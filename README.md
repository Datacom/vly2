# How to build it

Voluntarily is based on the [MERN (MongoDB, Express, React+Redux, Node)](http://mern.io/) software stack but also uses next.js to keep things clean and simple. Everything should work out of the box. There are two choices:

1. install NodeJS and MongoDB and run locally - [See here for detailed instructions](
   "Instructions")

2. install Docker and run in a container - [See here for detailed instructions](https://github.com/voluntarily/vly2/blob/master/docs/Docker.md "Instructions")

### Available Commands

1. `npm run dev` - starts the development server with hot reloading enabled

2. `npm run build` - bundles the code

3. `npm run test` - start the test runner

4. `npm run start` - runs production server

5. `npm run check-coverage` - generates test coverage report

6. `npm run lint` - runs standard to check for lint errors ( npm run fix to fix lint errors )

7. `npm run storybook` - starts the Storybook Component Library


Once you see the message: 

    "Voluntarily is running on port: 3122! Be Awesome!" 

then you can open your browser at http://localhost:3122.

If you see the message _"Please make sure Mongodb is installed and running!"_  then go back and start mongod.

Press `ctrl + c` to exit the node application.
